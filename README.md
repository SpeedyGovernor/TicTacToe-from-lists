Pretty cool project - it's tic-tac-toe purely in text using lists. Compete againsst the computer using numbers that correspond to the grid (easier than typing 'top left' or 'bottom right'. The grid is given to you below the playing board, so it's a fairly simple and fun game to play.

#Sad comment:( I had a version where the computer is smart, buuuut because I didn't have an actual computer to download to it's gone. I'm going to remake it sometime soon  :)
